# What is Python?

Python is a multi-purpose script language created by Guido Von Rossum, first released in 1991.

It is inspired by languages like ABC, Java, C/C++ and also have a strong influence over other languages like Go, CoffeeScript
Julia, Javascript, Ruby, Swift.

It's name is based on a British comedy series called Monty Python which the author used to watch while developing the language. 

## Python and PHP

Both languages are OpenSource

Both languages are easy to learn

Python has a liner syntax that enforces you to use spaces as a block delimiter while PHP define the blocks by using '{', '}', '(', ')', etc.

```
a = False
if a:
     print("True")
else: 
     print("False")
```

```
$a = false;
if ($a) {
    print("True");
} else {
    print("False");
}
```
Both are dynamic typed interpreted programming languages. However Python is a Strong Typed while PHP is weakly typed.

```
a = "1"
a = 1
a +""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

```
php > $a = 1;
php > $a = "1";
php > print($a + 2);

```
