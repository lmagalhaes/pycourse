# What is Python?

Python is a open-source, powerful, multi-purpose script language created by [Guido Von Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first released in 1991.

It was inspired by languages like ABC, Java, C/C++ and also have a strong influence over other languages like Go, CoffeeScript
Julia, Javascript, Ruby, Swift.

It's name is based on a British comedy series called Monty Python which the author used to watch while developing the language.

# Why to use Python?

Python core is very small and is present in most modern Linux distros, as well as Mac OSX. 

Furthermore, Python's simplicity, readability make its learning curve really low and, anyone with 
basic programming skills can start writing scripts, right away.

Due to its varied range of libraries, Python can be used for practically everything, from writing small scripts (to help you with simple daily tasks) to the development of complex scientific applications and it has been hugely 
adopted by companies, like, just to name a few:

 * Google
 * Dropbox (where [Guido Von Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) currently works) 
 * Facebook
 * Mozzila
 * Nasa
 * Reddit
 
Also, the [Python Community](https://www.python.org/community/) is huge and very active. 
 
### Other reasons to adopt Python

* Is among the [Top 10 Most Popular Technologies](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-popular-technologies) in [StackOVerFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* The [most popular introductory teaching language in U.S. universities](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-u-s-universities/fulltext),
* Among [Most Popular and Influential Programming Languages of 2018](https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/)
* Has risen steadily over the past 15 years


# Python zen (PEP 20)

Python zen is a list of 20 principles that influenced the design of the language. It is described on the [PEP-20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

You can see the whole zen philosophy by importing ```this``` on the interactive python shell:
```python
$ python
Python 2.7.14 (default, Apr 10 2018, 17:14:16) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)] on darwin

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

# Python enhancement Proposal (PEP)

Python enhancement Proposal or simply PEP, is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. 

The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature 

There are 3 kinds of PEP: 

1. Standards Track
2. Informational
3. Process


## Standard tracks

Describes a new feature or implementation for Python, for example:

* [PEP-553](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/), that defines a new ```debugging``` function that is an alias for 
```import pdb; pdb.set_trace()```.


## Informational
 
Describes a Python design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Python community, for example:
* [PEP-0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/): Constans an index of Python Enhancement Proposals


## Process

Describes a process surrounding Python, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PEPs 
are like Standards Track PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself, for example:
 
* [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): Style Guide for Python Code
